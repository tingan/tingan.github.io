<h3>Motivation</h3>
For overseas Chinese kids, learning how to write chinese character is not easy. I want to create a chinese character writing app for my 5 years old son. But I think pure chinese character writing app would be very boring. So the idea is to create a Chinese audio books with Chinese poems and related chinese character in the poems for learning. Also the app will provide some games for Chinese character learning.
