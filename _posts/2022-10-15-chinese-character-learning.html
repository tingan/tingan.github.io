<h3>Motivation</h3>
For overseas Chinese kids, learning how to write chinese character is not easy. I want to create a chinese character writing app for my 5 years old son. But I think pure chinese character writing app would be very boring. So the idea is to create a Chinese audio books with Chinese poems and related chinese character in the poems for learning. Also the app will provide some games for Chinese character learning.

<h3>Technology stack choice</h3>
The app would be more like a static website. Therefore, I consider some static web sites technologies such as Jekyll, Hugo and GatsbyJs. GatsbyJs is built on top of React and GraphQL. As I think it's would be easier for me to use GatsbyJs and practice GraphQL technology. So the technology stack is GatsByjS + React Hooks + GraphQL. Netlify is chosen for hosting.
