<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p>Quizlet is quite popular for foreign language learning. But it has many limitations for free account. I want to create a small web app for Finnish learning.</p>

<h2>Technology stack choice</h2>

<p>Although it's easy to do it in Laravel as I am already very familiar with it, but I consider Laravel will be a little heavy for such a small web app. As I am familiar with React, Redux, React Hooks, it would be easy to develop the app by MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node). For styling, although the Bootstrap will be a good choice, but I decide to give TailWindCSS a shot. As TailWindCSS is a new way of styling comparing with SASS and it's quit popular. so the technology stack choice is MERN + TailWindCSS.</p>
